# XGBoost libomp Solution for Mac

## Problem
XGBoost was failing with the error:
```
Library not loaded: @rpath/libomp.dylib
```

## Solution
Since you have Homebrew installed, the solution was straightforward:

1. **Install libomp using Homebrew:**
   ```bash
   /opt/homebrew/bin/brew install libomp
   ```

2. **Verify XGBoost is working:**
   ```bash
   source xgboost_env/bin/activate
   python -c "import xgboost; print('XGBoost version:', xgboost.__version__)"
   ```

## Result
- libomp version 20.1.8 was successfully installed at `/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libomp/20.1.8`
- XGBoost 3.0.2 is now fully operational in the `xgboost_env` virtual environment
- The model can now be used for the cocoa market signals project

## Notes
- The libomp library is keg-only, meaning it wasn't symlinked into `/opt/homebrew`
- This is intentional to avoid conflicts with GCC headers
- XGBoost automatically finds the library in the Homebrew Cellar location

## Testing
Successfully tested XGBoost with:
- Basic training functionality
- DMatrix creation
- Sklearn interface (XGBRegressor)
- Model predictions

The XGBoost implementation in `src/models/advanced_time_series_models.py` is now ready to use.
