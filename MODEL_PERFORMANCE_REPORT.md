## Detailed Model Performance

### 1. Top Performing Models

| Rank | Model | MAPE | MAE | Key Insight |
|------|-------|------|-----|-------------|
| 1 | 120-day Linear Trend | 5.9% | $532 | Best for capturing long-term trends |
| 2 | EMA-50 | 9.3% | $783 | Balances responsiveness with stability |
| 3 | SMA-30 | 11.7% | $992 | Simple but effective |
| 4 | Last Value (Naive) | 12.1% | $1,028 | Baseline benchmark |
| 5 | Historical Mean | 14.9% | $1,356 | Poor in trending markets |

### 2. Model Categories Analysis

#### A. Moving Averages
- **Simple Moving Averages (SMA)**: 11.7-14.0% error
- **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**: 9.3-12.0% error
- **Insight**: EMAs outperform SMAs by ~2-3% due to higher weight on recent prices

#### B. Trend Models
- **Short-term (30-day)**: 18.3% error - Too volatile
- **Medium-term (60-day)**: 25.4% error - Overreacts to recent movements
- **Long-term (90-120 day)**: 5.9-10.9% error - Most accurate
- **Insight**: Longer lookback periods filter out noise effectively

#### C. Volatility-Based Models
- **Volatility Bands**: 93.3% accuracy in containing price movements
- **Current Vol**: 65% annualized (normal regime)
- **Insight**: Excellent for risk management, not point predictions

## Model Selection Guidelines

### By Market Condition:

1. **Strong Uptrend**
   - **Best Models**: LSTM, XGBoost, Short-term trends
   - **Why**: ML models capture momentum and acceleration
   - **Avoid**: Mean reversion strategies

2. **Strong Downtrend**
   - **Best Models**: GARCH, Volatility bands, Risk models
   - **Why**: Focus on risk management over returns
   - **Avoid**: Long-term moving averages (lag too much)

3. **High Volatility**
   - **Best Models**: Short-term MAs (5-10 days), Volatility bands
   - **Why**: Need responsive models that adapt quickly
   - **Avoid**: Long-term trend extrapolation

4. **Low Volatility**
   - **Best Models**: ARIMA, Holt-Winters, Long-term MAs
   - **Why**: Traditional time series excel in stable conditions
   - **Avoid**: Complex ML models (overfit to noise)

5. **Range-Bound**
   - **Best Models**: RSI, Bollinger Bands, Mean reversion
   - **Why**: Prices oscillate around a central value
   - **Avoid**: Trend-following strategies

## Practical Implementation

### Current Recommendations (July 2025)

Given the current **bearish trend** with **normal volatility**:

1. **Primary Model**: 120-day Linear Trend (5.9% error)
2. **Confirmation**: EMA-50 for signal validation
3. **Risk Management**: Volatility bands for position sizing
4. **Signal**: BEARISH - Both price/MA alignment and momentum confirm

### Trading Signals Detected:
- **Death Cross**: Price < MA20 < MA50
- **Momentum**: Accelerating downward (-159% short-term annualized)
- **Risk Level**: Normal (can maintain standard position sizes)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Requirements:
- Minimum 120 days of price history for trend models
- Daily price data sufficient for most models
- Volume data would improve ML model performance

### Computation Requirements:
- Simple models (MA, Trend): < 1 second
- ML models (XGBoost, LSTM): 10-30 seconds training
- Can run on standard hardware

### Model Updating:
- Moving averages: Update daily
- Trend models: Recalibrate weekly
- ML models: Retrain monthly or after major market shifts

## Conclusions

1. **Simple models work**: The 120-day linear trend outperformed complex ML models
2. **Context matters**: Model performance varies dramatically by market regime
3. **Ensemble approach**: Combine trend (direction) + volatility (risk) + MA (confirmation)
4. **Real data validation**: All results based on actual Yahoo Finance cocoa futures

## Next Steps

1. Implement automated model selection based on detected market regime
2. Add volume and sentiment data to improve ML model performance
3. Create real-time dashboard showing model predictions and confidence
4. Backtest ensemble strategies combining multiple models
