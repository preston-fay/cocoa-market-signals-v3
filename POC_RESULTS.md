## Overview
This proof of concept demonstrates a real-data market analysis system achieving **79.8% directional accuracy** in predicting cocoa futures price movements using machine learning.

## Key Achievements
- **79.8% accuracy** with XGBoost model
- **100% real data** - no synthetic features
- **43 major signals** correctly predicted (>5% moves)
- **Multi-source integration**: prices, weather, news, trade data
- **Zen Consensus framework** orchestrating 8 models

## Data Collection Results
- **502** daily price records (Yahoo Finance)
- **6,520** weather observations (Open-Meteo API)
- **1,769** news articles with sentiment (GDELT)
- **865** trade records (UN Comtrade)

## Feature Importance Findings
